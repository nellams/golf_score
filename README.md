Golf Score Tabulator

That's a wrap! You've completed your first round of golf, and now it's time to tabulate your score. In the game of golf, you count how many times you hit the ball per hole, and that makes up your score. Each hole has a par value, or a guess at how many times you should hit the ball for any given hole.

For every hole, you can either be under par, at par, or over par. For example, if you scored a 5 on a par 4 hole, you are one over par. If you scored a 2 on a par 3 hole, you are one under par.

Here's how you did:

Hole 1 (Par 5): 7
Hole 2 (Par 4): 5
Hole 3 (Par 3): 3
Hole 4 (Par 4): 4
Hole 5 (Par 4): 4
Hole 6 (Par 3): 2
Hole 7 (Par 4): 5
Hole 8 (Par 5): 5
Hole 9 (Par 4): 5
Hole 10 (Par 5): 7
Hole 11 (Par 4): 4
Hole 12 (Par 4): 4
Hole 13 (Par 3): 3
Hole 14 (Par 4): 5
Hole 15 (Par 4): 5
Hole 16 (Par 4): 4
Hole 17 (Par 3): 3
Hole 18 (Par 5): 6
Utilize compound data structures to calculate your score.

Here's what the sample output to your terminal might look like (for the data above):
